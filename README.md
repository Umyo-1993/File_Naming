Hi , I always feel lazy enough to name a file . So I was thinking of creating a python script.In version 1 it will suggest a name depending on your inputs and time . Version 2 will 
open a txt file according to the naming and Version 3 will open a doc file containing some html templates. Now why I used Html template where I could do using a python library . Yes,
certainly but sometimes it has some conflicts so what I did is to make it cross platform compatible .. Feel free to contribute here ... U Mo
